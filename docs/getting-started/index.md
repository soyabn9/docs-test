# Learning the Basics

This guide will show you how to set up a server.

!!! Note ""
    We are not going to be creating an account in this guide as you should already have one.

## Step 1 - Create Server

First, you will need to create a server if you don't already have one.

When logging into the account you will see a big green button that says 'Create Server' clicking it will direct you to the server creation page.

A direct link to the create server page: https://panel.freemcserver.net/server/create

Now a guide in creating the server:

### Giving the server a name

The server has to be named so input a name and then move on to choosing the location.

??? question "Can the server be named whatever I want?"
    Yes, the server can be named whatever you want.

??? question "Can the name be changed later?"
    Yes, the name can be changed later.

### Choosing a location

Now, you will have to choose the location for where your server is going to be hosted on. We only have two locations, `North America` and `Germany` while `Germany (VIP)` is locked until the server has an existing upgrade.

When there is space available select it and move on to choosing a server type.

### Choosing server type

There are two free server types available when creating a server. The one you decide to choose will have to depend on how much RAM you decide to take for your server.

The following two server types and when you should pick them.

**Always Online:**

- If the server will be MCBE (Minecraft Bedrock Edition)

- Server version is below 1.13

**High Memory:**

- Server version is above 1.13

- Server is going to use a big amount of redstone

- A server using many plugins (10 - 20)
